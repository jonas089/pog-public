This project is a hardfork of the "Pigeoncoin" source code.
"Pigeoncoin" invented the x16s algorithm based on the "Ravencoin" source code,
which invented the x16r algorithm.

Every "altcoin" including this one is open source and has is own unique blockchain.


The reason for publishing this source code is, to secure the network by offering people the
possibility to setup nodes, run servers, compile wallets for other distributions etc.
